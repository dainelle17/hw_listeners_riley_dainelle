    <h2> I Love Andy Warhol </h2>

        <p> Andy Warhol was a leading artist in the pop art movement. His works
        explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture,
        and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career
        as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes
        controversial artist. </p>
